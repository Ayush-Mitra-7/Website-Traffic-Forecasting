This is an End to End Project where a web app is created to show how the model works and
interacts with the a front end structure.

![Web app](screenshots/pic1.png)

The interface takes the number of days to be forecasted as input 
and will show a plot on a new page where the forecasted data is shown.The
image below is an example of forecasted data for 10 days

The forecasting was done using ARIMA algorithm.ARIMA has three 
parts AR-I-MA,AR means Auto Regression,I means Integrity and 
MA means Moving Average.
